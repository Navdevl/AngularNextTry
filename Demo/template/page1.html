<p class="h1 template">Story of our hero</p>
<p class="info"> Hey folks, this is all about the story of our hero. Yes, it's all about me. I am not going to tell anything about my history or hierarchy because even I don't know about it well. So, let's talk about ME. I am Naveen Honest Raj. I am introvert who can very well pretend like an extrovert. So people believe that I am easy going and party type. Well, the real thing is secret. Ssssshhhh.. Let me tell you people. But you should keep it all secret. Okay.! I really do love staying at my home and reading books. Even the books I read already or maybe twice.. thrice too.. Hahaha..! Yeah and do you know what.? I have my own world of imagination where I will live the most of the time. And I made half of the things implemented in my real world. One of them is to CODE. Yeah, at first I was really very bad at coding. But now, I can do pretty well. Imaginations coming true, it seems. Haha.. Yeah.. I do wanted a friend to whom I can totally depend upon. Yes, I know that people say "BEING INDEPENDENT IS STRENGTH". But, I love that feel of being dependent and mutually having same vibe and enjoying it. And there are lot of things to share.! If you wanted to know more about me, PM me <a href="https://www.facebook.com/navdevl">@NaveenDurai</a> in Facebook.

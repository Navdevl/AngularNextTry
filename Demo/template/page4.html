<p class="info">Love can destroy person - really? It did pushed me to go further. Not really, love. Love-off did that to me. People say when you are so much dependent on a person, you'll one day get hurt. Lol.! Seriously?? The gift of loving a person is pain.! I was laughing at them untill life happened. That pain could really destroy a person. I felt that. Do you know what.? Everytime when you face something, you always have two options. Give up or Move Up.! I chose MOVE UP. It wasn't simple. But worth it. One fine day, when you wake up and realize that you are completely healed, you can feel the pleasant and warm joy filling your world. You could smile without pretending like smiling. You could literally make jokes and yes, you won't have any other process going inside your head. Everything in life happens for a reason. Simple as that. Never give up.

<p class="h1 template">Art, it is <3</p>
<p class="info"> Untill, I saw my HELLO WORLD program output, I wasn't that much fascinated towards programming. But that small output of a C code triggered something inside me. A rush of excitement and temptation to explore more of programming. That drove me crazy and led me to check everything. I was not satisfied after that. People see code as some complex stuff. It's like an art, where you need to slowly paint instructions for the output that you imagined to display. You feel the same excitement when you completed a painting or poetry. You feel peace after seeing your code run like a baby. You want to feed it to make it perfect. More perfect and perfect.!

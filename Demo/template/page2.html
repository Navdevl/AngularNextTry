<p class="h1 template">DragonBall, Seriously?</p>
<p class="info"> One of the best thing that happened in my chilhood is DRAGONBALL. If you are going to judge me for this, I am least bothered. Let me tell you about the things, the anime taught me. First, No one is bad because even VEGETA who was a prince, a cruel prince, turned to a loving father and friend. Next thing is the famous dialog, "TO GO EVEN FURTHER BEYOND". This one inspired and motivated me to do a lot of things. Even to debug 1000s of errors. I have seen Goku as a kid. And now., he is grown up and has a family and two kids. The greatest part is that one of his kid GOHAN too now have a kid. Things changed a lot. Now Goku isn't a small child. He has responsibilities, family and maturity. Everytime, I watch Dragonball , I feel so much into it :)
